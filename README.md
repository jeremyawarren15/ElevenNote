## Synopsis
This is a simple note-taking app. The whole project was developed in C# using ASP .NET MVC 5. Users can register and create, update, and delete notes. I also added a feature to star important messages. Right now this is not deployed so it will only work locally, but it is still a functional web application.

## Motivation
I built this application because I was new to .NET and wanted to learn a little bit more about MVC. I feel like this was a good project to get a feel for everthing. It has definitely helped me with my other projects that I have done. I thought it was especially good to go through actually starting a project. Those decisions are important and I learned a lot about Entity Framework and Razor syntax.

## Installation
If you would like to build this project to view for yourself you will need Visual Studio. To run, all you have to do is open the solution and make sure that the web project is the default project and then hit Run in toolbar in Visual Studio. The application should build a database for you to use.
